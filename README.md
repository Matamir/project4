To get the code working from the starter code, I first ran 'testall' to see what tests I would have to pass.  I started my implementation by coming up with a way to handle dropped packets.  My solution to this was to have the sender save the most recent packet(s) that it sent, in case they needed to be retransmitted.  If the sender doesn't recieve an ack, for a packet, it retransmits that packet.  For here, implementing the handling of repeat packets was fairly simple, as I would send the ack for that packet again, under the assumption that the ack was lost.

One major challenge that I faced was creating a sliding window functionality, and implementing some way to increasing and decreasing the size of the window based on how well packets were transmitting.  I attempted do implement these features, however I could not figure out exactly how to get them to work reliably, and my code already passed the tests without these features, so I reverted to a previous version that worked.

To test my code, I created a DEBUG variable that was set to either True or False.  If True, useful information would be printed into the console any time the scripts run, allowing me to get a better understanding of what the code was actually doing, so I could fix any errors that would arise.  If set to False, this information simply doesn't print.
